<h1><a href="#">Pan-Canadian Energy System Model</a></h1>
<h2>using the Temoa modelling framework<h2>
<p>I'm working with groups at the University of Toronto and the University of Calgary in the development of an open-source, pan-Canadian energy system model. This resource planning tool will be able to test the effects of proposed policy and explore potential national energy futures by capturing inter-regional, inter-temporal and inter-sectoral interactions.</p>
