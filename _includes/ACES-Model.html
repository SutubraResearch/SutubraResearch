<h1>ACES Model Development</h1>
<p>We led the technical development of the <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca/acesmodel/about">Atlantic Canada Energy System (ACES) Model</a>. Funded by both Federal and Provincial governments and orchestrated by Net-Zero Atlantic, this project culminated in a decision-support tool that empowers Atlantic Canadians to explore "what-if" scenarios concerning the long-term evolution of our energy system.</p>
