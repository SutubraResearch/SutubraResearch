<h1>Long Duration Energy Storage</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>We're leading a <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca/research/exploring-pathways-net-zero-utilizing-advanced-energy-system-modelling">research project</a>  funded by Nova Scotia's Net Zero Emerging Concepts and Technologies Research Program. The project aims to explore the role of long-duration energy storage in decarbonizing Nova Scotia's electricity system by 2050. We're building upon the open-source Atlantic Canada Energy System model, originally developed by Sutubra Research. This endeavor is a collaborative effort with Dr. Lukas Swan of the <a href="https://resl.me.dal.ca/">Renewable Energy Storage Laboratory</a> at Dalhousie University, and aims to both leverage and enhance the existing model.</p>
