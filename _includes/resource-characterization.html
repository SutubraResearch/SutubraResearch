<h1><a href="#">Wind Resource Characterization</a></h1>
<h2>in Atlantic Canada<h2>
<p>I developed an interactive tool to explore and characterize Atlantic Canada's wind power resource. Outputs from this tool were then integrated into a power system capacity expansion model to deliver insights related to the future of wind power development <code>&#8212;</code> and the power sector transition more broadly <code>&#8212;</code> in the region.</p>
