<h1>ACES Model Development</h1>
<h2><h2>
<p>I led the tehnical development of the <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca/acesmodel/about">Atlantic Canada Energy System (ACES) Model</a>. The project, which was funded by Federal and Provincial governments and led by Net-Zero Atlantic, created a decision support tool Atlantic Canadians can  use to help answer “what if” scenario questions regarding the future long-term development of our energy system.
