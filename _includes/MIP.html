<h1><a href="#">Model Intercomparison Study</a></h1>
<h2>of open-source power system models<h2>
<p>The <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10007">Model Intercomparison Project</a> seeks to compare the performance of four of the leading open-source power system planning models for identifying a least-cost transition path for the US power system under a range of scenarios, including complete decarbonization. This comparison is more specific than most previous comparisons, not just identifying different results from the models, but (a) using an operational simulation to identify which provides the most cost-effective plan in each test case and (b) using a systematic approach to identify which differences are due to configuration choices (replicable across models) and which are due to fundamental differences between the modelsâ€™ implementations.

The four modelling platforms are: Temoa (Carnegie Mellon University, NC State University and Sutubra Research), GenX (Princeton and MIT), SWITCH (University of Hawaii and Environmental Defense Fund) and USENSYS (Environmental Defense Fund).</p>
