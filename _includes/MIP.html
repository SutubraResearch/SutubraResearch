<h1>Model Intercomparison Project</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>We're participating in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10007">model intercomparison project</a> aimed at benchmarking four leading open-source power system planning models. The goal is to identify the most cost-effective transition pathways for the U.S. power system across various scenarios, while rigorously evaluating the robustness of decarbonization plans and comparing the performance of each model.</p>
<p>Supported by the Sloan Foundation, the project involves four modeling platforms: <b>Temoa</b> (Carnegie Mellon University, NC State University, and Sutubra Research), <b>GenX</b> (Princeton and MIT), <b>SWITCH</b> (University of Hawaii and Environmental Defense Fund), and <b>USENSYS</b> (Environmental Defense Fund).</p>
