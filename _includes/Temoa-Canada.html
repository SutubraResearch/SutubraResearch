<h1>Pan-Canadian Energy System Model</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>We're collaborating with teams from the University of Toronto and the University of Calgary to create an open-source, pan-Canadian energy system model. This advanced planning tool is designed to assess the impact of proposed policies and explore diverse national energy futures by capturing complex interactions across regions, timeframes, and sectors.</p>
