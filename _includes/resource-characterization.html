<h1>Wind Resource Characterization</h1>
<p>We developed an interactive tool to explore and characterize Atlantic Canada's wind power resource. Outputs from this tool were then integrated into a power system capacity expansion model to deliver insights related to the future of wind power development <code>&#8212;</code> and the power sector transition more broadly <code>&#8212;</code> in the region.</p>
