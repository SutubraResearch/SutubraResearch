<h1><a href="#">Long Duration Energy Storage</a></h1>
<h2>and its outlook in Nova Scotia<h2>
<p>This <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca/research/exploring-pathways-net-zero-utilizing-advanced-energy-system-modelling">research project</a> seeks to determine the potential role of long-duration energy storage in achieving a decarbonized electricity system in Nova Scotia by 2050. This work leverages and will enhance the open-source Atlantic Canada Energy System model, which was previously developed by Sutubra Research, and will be done in partnership with Dr. Lukas Swan of the <a href="https://resl.me.dal.ca/">Renewable Energy Storage Laboratory</a> at Dalhousie University.</p>
