<h1>Model Development</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>We're collaborating with experts from Carnegie Mellon University and NC State University to enhance the widely-used open-source energy system model, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://temoacloud.com/">Temoa</a>, as well as its companion project, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/key-initiatives/open-energy-outlook/index.html">the Open Energy Outlook (OEO)</a>.</p>
<p>Our contributions primarily center on the ongoing refinement of the Temoa energy system optimization model, where we apply state-of-the-art practices from mathematical optimization and macro-energy systems. In addition, we work closely with team members to conceptualize, execute, and interpret scenarios for the OEO, a project that <i>"examines U.S. energy futures to inform energy and climate policy efforts by applying the gold standards of policy-focused academic modeling." </i></p>
